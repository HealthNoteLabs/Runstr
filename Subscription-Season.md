---

## üèóÔ∏è **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Fix Feed Filtering** (Priority: HIGH) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Ensure participant feed only shows kind 1301 workout notes from subscribers with activity mode filtering
- [x] **Activity Mode Integration**: Added `useActivityMode` import to `useLeagueRunFeed.ts`
- [x] **Enhanced Filtering**: Updated `participantPosts()` to filter by subscription status AND activity mode
- [x] **Consistent Logic**: Applied same activity matching logic from `useRunFeed.js` (run/running/jog, cycle/cycling/bike, walk/walking/hike)
- [x] **Kind 1301 Validation**: Inherited from underlying `useRunFeed('RUNSTR')` which already filters for RUNSTR workout events
- [x] **Fallback Handling**: Allows events without exercise tags (same as existing logic)

**Implementation Details**:
- ‚úÖ `participantPosts()` now applies dual filtering: subscriber status first, then activity mode
- ‚úÖ Uses existing activity matching map for consistent behavior across the app
- ‚úÖ Maintains console logging for debugging filtered events
- ‚úÖ Preserves all existing subscription and caching functionality

**Files Modified**:
- ‚úÖ `src/hooks/useLeagueRunFeed.ts` - Added activity mode filtering

### **Phase 2: Add Wallet Balance Monitoring** (Priority: HIGH) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Display growing rewards pool from subscription payments

- [x] **Real-time Updates**: Automatic polling every 30 seconds with manual refresh option for all wallets
- [x] **Prize Distribution**: Shows 1st/2nd/3rd place amounts (50%/30%/20% split) from prize pool
- [x] **Split Configuration**: External wallet splits automatically distribute funds to Open Sats and App Dev
- [x] **UI Integration**: Added above LeagueMap in RunClub.jsx with responsive 3-column grid
- [x] **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with individual wallet error states
- [x] **Styling**: Matches minimalistic black/white design with semantic wallet icons

**Implementation Details**:
- ‚úÖ `useSubscriptionWalletBalance.ts` polls all 3 NWC wallets simultaneously via Promise.all
- ‚úÖ `RewardsPoolDisplay.jsx` displays 3-wallet grid (Prize Pool üèÜ, Open Sats üéØ, App Dev ‚ö°)
