# Subscription Implementation Plan

**Target**: Two-tier subscription system (Member 5k/Captain 10k sats) following Season Pass patterns  
**Approach**: Nostr-native with Kind 33407 subscription receipts + NIP-51 lists  
**Timeline**: 2 weeks for core subscription flow  
**Status**: üöÄ Ready for Implementation  

## System Overview

### Subscription Architecture (Identical to Season Pass)
1. User pays subscription (5k Member / 10k Captain)
2. App publishes **Kind 33407** subscription receipt event
3. Admin runs script to verify payments and update NIP-51 lists
4. App checks subscription status from NIP-51 lists

### Nostr Event Structure

**Subscription Receipt Event (Kind 33407):**
```javascript
{
  kind: 33407,
  tags: [
    ["d", "runstr-subscription-02-2025"], // Format: runstr-subscription-{MM}-{YYYY}
    ["tier", "member"], // or "captain"
    ["amount", "5000"], // or "10000" for captain
    ["purchase_date", "1738339200"], // Unix timestamp
    ["expires", "1740931200"], // Unix timestamp (30 days later)
    ["payment_hash", "..."], // For verification
  ],
  content: "", // Can be encrypted payment details
  created_at: 1738339200,
  pubkey: "user-pubkey"
}
```

**NIP-51 Subscription Lists (Kind 30000):**
- `runstr-members-02-2025` - All active member subscribers for February 2025
- `runstr-captains-02-2025` - All active captain subscribers for February 2025

## Technical Implementation Details

### Storage Strategy
```javascript
// LocalStorage (for offline support)
'monthlySubscriptions' - Current user's subscription data
'subscriptionCache' - Cached NIP-51 lists

// Nostr Events
Kind 33407 - Subscription receipts (published by users)
Kind 30000 - NIP-51 subscription lists (published by admin)
```

### Subscription Status Checking
```javascript
// Check subscription status (similar to Season Pass)
async function isUserSubscribed(userPubkey) {
  // 1. Check cached NIP-51 lists
  const cachedStatus = checkCachedSubscriptionLists(userPubkey);
  if (cachedStatus) return cachedStatus;
  
  // 2. Fetch latest NIP-51 lists from relays
  const lists = await fetchSubscriptionLists();
  
  // 3. Check if user is in member or captain list
  return checkUserInLists(userPubkey, lists);
}
```

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Payment**: Uses existing NWC wallet infrastructure
- **Events**: Follows existing Nostr event patterns
- **UI**: Extends existing modal and profile patterns
- **Access Control**: Integrates with existing participant checking

## Risk Mitigation

### Low-Risk Implementation
- **Follows Existing Patterns**: Based on proven Season Pass code
- **Manual Admin Control**: Admin manages lists initially
- **Gradual Rollout**: Can test with small group first
- **Reversible**: Can disable subscriptions without affecting Season Pass

### Backup Plans
- **Payment Issues**: Fall back to manual subscription management
- **Event Publishing Fails**: Store locally and retry
- **List Updates Fail**: Use cached data with manual updates
- **Captain Features**: Can be restricted if issues arise

---

## Current Status & Next Steps

**Current Status**: Ready to begin implementation  
**Next Step**: Create monthlySubscriptionService.js based on seasonPassPaymentService.ts  
**Priority**: Core subscription flow (Phase 1) first, enhancements later  

**Key Principle**: Keep it simple, follow existing patterns, iterate based on user feedback
