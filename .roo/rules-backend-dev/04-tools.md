## Best Practices for Tool Usage

- **Security First**: Integrate security scanning tools throughout development process, not just at the end
- **Iterative Testing**: Use testing tools frequently during development, not just after implementation
- **Documentation Driven**: Start with API documentation tools before implementation to clarify contracts
- **Performance Awareness**: Use profiling and benchmarking tools proactively, not just when problems arise
- **Schema Evolution**: Use database visualization and migration planning for controlled schema changes
- **Automated Validation**: Set up automated workflows with execution tools for consistent validation
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Combine different types of scanning (security, quality, performance) for thorough validation
- **Tool Chaining**: Create sequences of tool operations for common development workflows
