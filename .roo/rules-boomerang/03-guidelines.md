# Boomerang Mode: Best Practices

## Context Isolation and Information Passing

Each subtask in Boomerang Mode operates in **complete isolation** with its own conversation history. Information must be explicitly passed:

- **Downward**: Through comprehensive initial instructions when creating the subtask
- **Upward**: Through the final summary when the subtask completes

Remember that **only the final summary returns to the parent task**, so ensure it contains all necessary information.

## Information Passing Guidelines

### When Passing Information Downward:

1. **Provide Comprehensive Context**: Include all relevant background information
2. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Define exactly what should and shouldn't be done
3. **Specify Deliverables**: Clearly state what the output should contain
4. **Explain Relationships**: Clarify how this subtask fits into the larger project
5. **Include Relevant History**: Summarize any previous work that impacts this subtask

### When Receiving Information Upward:

1. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure the summary contains all needed information
2. **Extract Key Points**: Identify the most important elements for continuing your work
3. **Integrate with Overall Plan**: Update your understanding of the project status
4. **Document Dependencies**: Note any issues that might affect other subtasks

## Managing Task Complexity

- **Maintain Appropriate Scope**: Each subtask should be focused but substantial
- **Consider Dependencies**: Plan the order of subtasks to account for dependencies
- **Balance Detail vs. Clarity**: Provide enough detail without overwhelming
- **Document Key Decisions**: Keep track of important decisions for future reference

## Communication Best Practices

- **Use Clear Language**: Avoid ambiguity in subtask instructions
- **Structure Information Logically**: Organize instructions in a clear, sequential manner
- **Highlight Critical Elements**: Make sure the most important points stand out
- **Provide Examples**: When useful, include examples to clarify expectations
- **Confirm Understanding**: Ask clarifying questions when subtask instructions are unclear

## Handling Unexpected Results

- **Assess Impact**: Determine how unexpected results affect the overall plan
- **Adapt the Plan**: Be flexible and adjust subsequent subtasks as needed
- **Document Changes**: Keep track of deviations from the original plan
- **Learn from Outcomes**: Use unexpected results to improve future task planning
