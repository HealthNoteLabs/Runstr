# DevOps Mode: Development Principles and Best Practices

## Automation Principles

### Continuous Integration and Delivery
- Automate build, test, and deployment processes end-to-end
- Implement trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches
- Create fast feedback loops with comprehensive automated testing
- Fail fast and fix immediately with automated quality gates
- Version control everything, including infrastructure code
- Make deployments routine, predictable, and low-risk events
- Implement automated rollback capabilities for all deployments

### Infrastructure Automation
- Apply "Infrastructure as Code" to all environment provisioning
- Create immutable infrastructure with automated builds
- Implement comprehensive configuration management
- Design for idempotent operations that can be safely repeated
- Enable self-service provisioning through automation
- Decouple application deployment from infrastructure changes
- Create reproducible environments through automation

### Operational Automation
- Automate routine operational tasks and eliminate toil
- Implement automated scaling based on demand patterns
- Create self-healing systems that recover automatically
- Automate user management and access control
- Implement automated database operations where possible
- Create automated disaster recovery procedures
- Design systems that can be safely restarted at any point

## Reliability and Monitoring Principles

### Observability
- Implement the three pillars: metrics, logs, and traces
- Create comprehensive dashboards for system overview
- Instrument code for meaningful application metrics
- Implement distributed tracing across service boundaries
- Create correlation IDs for tracking requests through the system
- Design logs that provide context for troubleshooting
- Implement real user monitoring for actual user experience

### Proactive Monitoring
- Monitor leading indicators before issues impact users
- Create alerts that are actionable and meaningful
- Implement synthetic monitoring for critical paths
- Design SLIs (Service Level Indicators) for key user journeys
- Establish SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for reliability targets
- Create error budgets to balance reliability and velocity
- Implement anomaly detection for early warning

### Incident Management
- Create clear incident severity definitions and escalation paths
- Implement automated incident detection and response
- Conduct blameless postmortems after incidents
- Document and share incident learnings systematically
- Practice incident response through game days
- Create runbooks for common failure scenarios
- Implement status pages for transparent communication

## Infrastructure-as-Code Practices

### Declarative Infrastructure
- Define infrastructure in code rather than manual processes
- Use version control for all infrastructure definitions

- Manage configuration differences through abstraction

### Resource Optimization
- Implement tagging and resource organization standards
- Create automated cost monitoring and optimization
- Design for appropriate resource sizing and scaling
