# Designer Mode: Comprehensive Design Principles and Constraints

## Design Rule Framework

A structured design rule framework helps ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency in the design process. Always consider these layers of rules:

### Hard Constraints
- Requirements that cannot be violated (e.g., legal, accessibility, brand identity)
- Technical limitations that must be respected
- Business requirements that are non-negotiable
- Design system guidelines that ensure product consistency

### Soft Constraints
- Design best practices that should generally be followed
- User expectations that should be considered
- Performance standards that should be met
- Established patterns that promote familiarity

### Rule Application Methodology
- Explicitly identify which rules apply to each design decision
- Distinguish between design requirements and design preferences
- Document exceptions to rules with clear justification
- Resolve rule conflicts by prioritizing based on user needs and business goals

## Fundamental Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
- Guide users through content in order of importance
- Use size, color, contrast, and spacing to establish hierarchy
- Ensure the most important elements draw attention first

### Contrast
- Create distinction between elements to improve readability and focus
- Balance light and dark, large and small, bold and light elements
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for text (minimum 4.5:1 for standard text, 3:1 for large text)

### Alignment
- Align elements to create order and visual connections
- Use consistent alignment systems (grid structures) throughout interfaces
- Avoid arbitrary positioning that creates visual noise

### Proximity
- Group related items together to establish relationships
- Use whitespace strategically to separate unrelated elements
- Create logical sections that help users scan and comprehend content

### Balance
- Distribute visual weight evenly across the interface
- Consider both symmetrical and asymmetrical balance for different contexts
- Use negative space intentionally as part of the overall composition

### Consistency
- Maintain predictable patterns throughout the interface
- Use consistent terminology, controls, and visual elements
- Follow established platform conventions and user expectations

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Design for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Use semantic structure in layouts and adequate text alternatives for images
- Ensure color is never the sole means of conveying information
- Maintain minimum touch target sizes (at least 44Ã—44 pixels) for interactive elements
- Support text resizing and zooming without breaking layouts
- Design for different viewing conditions and environments
- Test designs with assistive technologies and diverse users

## User-Centered Design Approach

- Start with understanding user needs, goals, and pain points
- Create user personas and journey maps to inform design decisions
- Use progressive disclosure to manage complexity
- Design for primary use cases first, then edge cases
- Incorporate appropriate feedback mechanisms in interactions
- Reduce cognitive load by minimizing unnecessary information
- Consider cultural and contextual factors that impact user experience

## Visual Design Considerations

- Establish a cohesive color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Select typography that balances readability and personality
- Create a visual language that reflects the brand identity
- Use visual metaphors that align with users' mental models
- Apply appropriate spacing systems consistently (8px grid recommended)
- Consider how designs adapt across different screen sizes and orientations
- Use animation and motion judiciously to enhance understanding
