# Product Context

## Purpose & Vision

Runstr is a decentralized audio sharing platform built on the Nostr protocol. It aims to provide a censorship-resistant, user-controlled platform for creators and listeners to share and discover audio content without intermediaries controlling the experience.

## Problems Solved

### For Creators
- **Censorship Resistance**: Content cannot be removed by centralized authorities
- **Direct Audience Connection**: No platform algorithms controlling reach
- **Ownership Retention**: Creators maintain full rights and control over their content
- **Monetization Freedom**: Direct support models without platform fees

### For Listeners
- **Algorithm-Free Discovery**: Content discovery based on genuine community engagement
- **Privacy-Focused**: Minimal data collection compared to centralized platforms
- **Censorship Bypass**: Access to content regardless of geographic restrictions
- **Direct Creator Support**: Ability to support creators directly

### For the Broader Ecosystem
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Contributing to the growth of Nostr as a protocol
- **Open Standards**: Promoting interoperability through protocol-based design
- **Web3 Integration**: Bridging traditional web experience with web3 capabilities

## User Experience Goals

### Usability
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple, familiar audio player experience despite complex underlying technology
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all device types and screen sizes
- **Performance Focus**: Fast loading times and smooth playback even on moderate connections
- **Progressive Learning**: Basic functionality easily accessible, with advanced features discoverable as users grow

### Engagement
- **Content Discovery**: Effortless exploration of new content through feeds and recommendations
- **Social Features**: Commenting, sharing, and interacting with content creators and other listeners
- **Personalization**: Customized experience based on listening habits and preferences
- **Offline Access**: Ability to save content for offline listening (where implemented)

### Trust & Security
- **Key Management**: Secure but user-friendly handling of cryptographic keys
- **Transparent Operations**: Clear communication about how the platform works
- **Data Control**: Users maintain ownership and control of their data
- **Community Standards**: User-driven moderation rather than centralized control
