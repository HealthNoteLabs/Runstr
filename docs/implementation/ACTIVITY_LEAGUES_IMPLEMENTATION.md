# Activity-Specific Leagues Implementation

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented **Phase 1: Activity Mode-Driven Display** for the League tab. The league now filters by the user's current activity mode (Run/Walk/Cycle), creating separate leagues for each activity type.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Activity-Filtered Leaderboards**
- League now shows only the activities matching the user's current activity mode
- Run mode ‚Üí shows only running activities
- Walk mode ‚Üí shows only walking activities  
- Cycle mode ‚Üí shows only cycling activities

### 2. **Dynamic League Titles**
- **Run Mode**: "THE RUNSTR SEASON 1"
- **Walk Mode**: "THE WALKSTR 500" 
- **Cycle Mode**: "THE CYCLESTR 500"

### 3. **Activity-Specific Caching**
- Separate cache for each activity type
- Cache keys: `runstr_league_leaderboard_run`, `runstr_league_leaderboard_walk`, `runstr_league_leaderboard_cycle`
- 30-minute cache duration maintained per activity

### 4. **Automatic Updates**
- League refreshes automatically when user switches activity modes
- Maintains existing 30-minute auto-refresh functionality
- Background refresh strategy preserved

## üîß Technical Changes Made

### **Files Modified:**

#### `src/hooks/useLeagueLeaderboard.js`
- ‚úÖ Added `useActivityMode` import
- ‚úÖ Added activity mode filtering in `processEvents()` using `exercise` tag
- ‚úÖ Made cache keys activity-specific
- ‚úÖ Added `activityMode` to return object
- ‚úÖ Updated dependency arrays to include activity mode
- ‚úÖ Added effect to refresh when activity mode changes

#### `src/components/LeagueMap.jsx`
- ‚úÖ Added `activityMode` to destructured hook return
- ‚úÖ Created `getLeagueTitle()` function for dynamic titles
- ‚úÖ Updated hardcoded "THE RUNSTR SEASON 1" to use dynamic title
- ‚úÖ Added fallback handling for undefined activity mode

## üß™ How to Test

### **Testing Steps:**
1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to League tab** (bottom navigation)
3. **Switch activity modes** using the activity toggle in the app
4. **Observe the changes**:
   - League title changes ("RUNSTR SEASON 1" ‚Üí "WALKSTR 500" ‚Üí "CYCLESTR 500")
   - Leaderboard shows only activities matching the current mode
   - Race track positions update accordingly

### **What Should Happen:**
- **In Run Mode**: Only running activities (with `exercise: "run"` tag) appear
- **In Walk Mode**: Only walking activities (with `exercise: "walk"` tag) appear  
- **In Cycle Mode**: Only cycling activities (with `exercise: "cycle"` tag) appear
- **Switching modes**: League refreshes immediately with new filtered data
- **Caching**: Each activity mode has its own cached leaderboard

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **If the filtering isn't working:**
1. **Check browser console** for any errors from `useLeagueLeaderboard`
2. **Verify activity mode switching** - ensure the activity toggle is working
3. **Clear localStorage cache**: 
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.removeItem('runstr_league_leaderboard_run')
   localStorage.removeItem('runstr_league_leaderboard_walk') 
   localStorage.removeItem('runstr_league_leaderboard_cycle')
   ```
4. **Check 1301 events have exercise tags**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console, check if events have exercise tags
   console.log('Sample 1301 event tags:', events[0]?.tags)
   ```

### **Expected Console Logs:**
```
[useLeagueLeaderboard] Starting fetch...
[useLeagueLeaderboard] Fetching all 1301 events...
[useLeagueLeaderboard] Fetched XXX events
[useLeagueLeaderboard] Processed leaderboard with X users
```

### **Debugging Activity Filtering:**
The filtering logic looks for events with:
- Tag: `['exercise', 'run']` for running
- Tag: `['exercise', 'walk']` for walking  
- Tag: `['exercise', 'cycle']` for cycling

If events don't have these tags, they won't appear in any league.

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

### **Problem Solved:**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed duplicate entries**: Activity filtering eliminates cross-activity duplicates
- ‚úÖ **Activity-specific competition**: Users compete within their activity type
- ‚úÖ **Clean leaderboards**: No more mixing of running/walking/cycling distances

### **User Experience:**
- ‚úÖ **Intuitive behavior**: League matches user's current activity focus
- ‚úÖ **No UI complexity**: Uses existing activity mode system
- ‚úÖ **Fast performance**: Maintains existing caching and loading strategies
- ‚úÖ **Seamless integration**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

If users want to compare across activities, we can add:
- **Smart Toggle**: Switch between "Current Activity" and "All Activities" view
- **Activity Tabs**: Sub-tabs within League for Run/Walk/Cycle
- **Combined View**: Show all activities with visual differentiation

## üìä Data Flow

```
1. User Activity Mode (Run/Walk/Cycle)
   ‚Üì
2. useLeagueLeaderboard fetches all 1301 events
   ‚Üì  
3. Filter events by exercise tag matching activity mode
   ‚Üì
4. Process filtered events into leaderboard
   ‚Üì
5. Cache with activity-specific key
   ‚Üì
6. Display in LeagueMap with dynamic title
```
