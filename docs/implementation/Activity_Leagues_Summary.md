# Activity-Specific Leagues - Phase 1 Complete ✅

## What We Implemented

**Successfully implemented Activity Mode-Driven Display** for the League tab. The league now shows different leaderboards based on the user's current activity mode.

## Key Changes

### 1. Activity Filtering
- League now filters by current activity mode (Run/Walk/Cycle)
- Uses `exercise` tag from 1301 events for filtering
- Only shows activities matching the selected mode

### 2. Dynamic Titles  
- **Run Mode**: "THE RUNSTR SEASON 1"
- **Walk Mode**: "THE WALKSTR 500"
- **Cycle Mode**: "THE CYCLESTR 500"

### 3. Separate Caches
- Each activity mode has its own cache
- Cache keys: `runstr_league_leaderboard_{activity}`
- Maintains 30-minute cache duration

## Files Modified

1. **`src/hooks/useLeagueLeaderboard.js`**
   - Added activity mode filtering
   - Activity-specific cache keys
   - Auto-refresh on mode changes

2. **`src/components/LeagueMap.jsx`**
   - Dynamic league titles
   - Activity mode integration

## How to Test

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Go to League tab
3. Switch activity modes in the app
4. Observe title changes and filtered leaderboards

## Benefits

✅ **Fixed the duplicate 1301 entries issue**  
✅ **Separate competition for each activity type**  
✅ **Simple, intuitive user experience**  
✅ **No breaking changes to existing functionality**  
✅ **Maintains performance with activity-specific caching**

## Next Steps (Future)

Phase 2 could add a toggle to view all activities combined, but Phase 1 solves the immediate problem with the simplest, most reliable approach.
