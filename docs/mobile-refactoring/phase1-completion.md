# RUNSTR Mobile Refactoring: Phase 1 Completion

## Phase 1: Code Analysis & Preparation

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of the RUNSTR mobile-first refactoring. This phase focused on code analysis and preparation, setting the foundation for the transition to a mobile-only architecture.

### Accomplishments

#### 1. Codebase Audit & Analysis

✅ **Created Comprehensive Documentation:**
- Created codebase-audit.md documenting web-only code sections
- Identified all components requiring refactoring
- Mapped mobile-specific dependencies and requirements
- Created mobile-architecture.md outlining the new architecture

✅ **Created Component Refactoring Plan:**
- Detailed component-by-component refactoring guide
- Included code examples for each component
- Established timeline for phased implementation
- Created migration guidelines for incremental changes

#### 2. Core Infrastructure Implementation

✅ **Implemented Core Mobile Utilities:**
- Created `storage.js` with Capacitor Preferences integration
- Implemented `platform.js` for device detection and native features
- Built `network.js` for mobile-optimized network management
- Added `appState.js` for app lifecycle management

✅ **Added Mobile UI Foundation:**
- Implemented mobile-optimized BottomSheet component
- Created CSS with mobile-specific considerations

#### 3. Project Configuration

✅ **Updated Package Dependencies:**
- Added required Capacitor plugins:
  - @capacitor/preferences
  - @capacitor/haptics
  - @capacitor/network
  - @capacitor/app
  - @capacitor/dialog
  - @capacitor/toast

✅ **Updated Capacitor Configuration:**
- Added plugin-specific configurations
- Optimized for Android target platform

#### 4. Mobile Service Integration

✅ **Created Mobile Service Layer:**
- Implemented `MobileService.js` for centralized initialization
- Added app lifecycle event handling
- Integrated network state management
- Created migration utility for localStorage to Preferences

✅ **App Integration:**
- Updated App.jsx to initialize mobile services
- Integrated platform detection for conditional rendering
- Added error handling for mobile initialization

### Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Begin implementing the mobile storage context to replace direct localStorage usage
2. Refactor the RunTracker component to use the new mobile utilities
3. Update NostrContext to use the mobile-optimized network utilities
4. Begin creating mobile-specific UI components for the rest of the application
