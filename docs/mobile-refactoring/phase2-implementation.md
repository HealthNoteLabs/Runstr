# RUNSTR Mobile Refactoring: Phase 2 Implementation

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on refactoring core components to use mobile utilities and removing web-specific code. This phase will build upon the foundation established in Phase 1 to create a fully mobile-optimized experience.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Storage Context Implementation

- Create a `MobileStorageContext` to replace localStorage usage
- Update components to use the new context
- Implement data persistence with Capacitor Preferences

### 2. RunTracker Component Refactoring

- Refactor RunTracker to use mobile utilities
- Add mobile-specific features (haptic feedback, native UI)
- Optimize for background tracking and battery usage

### 3. Nostr Context Refactoring

- Update NostrContext to use mobile network utilities
- Implement offline queue functionality
- Add connection resilience for mobile networks

### 4. UI Component Refactoring

- Update Post.jsx to use BottomSheet for actions
- Refactor MenuBar.jsx for mobile-only navigation
- Replace modals with native mobile components

### 5. Mobile-Specific Screen Optimizations

- Update screens for mobile-only layouts
- Remove desktop-specific code
- Implement swipe gestures and touch interactions

## Implementation Schedule

| Week | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 1    | Storage Context | MobileStorageContext, localStorage migration |
| 2    | RunTracker Refactoring | Mobile-optimized tracking, offline support |
| 3    | Nostr Connectivity | Mobile network resilience, offline queue |
| 4    | UI Components | BottomSheet integration, mobile navigation |
| 5    | Screen Refactoring | Mobile-only layouts, gesture support |
| 6    | Testing & Optimization | Performance testing, battery optimization |

## Success Criteria

- All localStorage usage replaced with Capacitor Preferences
- Full offline support with data synchronization
- Consistent mobile UI patterns across all components
- Battery-efficient background processing
- Removal of all web-specific code and dependencies

## Migration Strategy

Components will be migrated incrementally to minimize disruption:

1. First implement mobile storage and utilities
2. Refactor each component to use the new utilities
3. Replace web UI patterns with mobile equivalents
4. Remove web-specific code once mobile alternatives are in place

This approach ensures the app remains functional throughout the refactoring process.
