        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What is RUNSTR?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          RUNSTR is a motion tracking app built on top of nostr. The project is built by TheWildHustle and TheNostrDev Team. 
          The project has been tinkered with for about 3 months, but development has picked up and its goals and direction have become much clearer.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          RUNSTR aims to become a Nike Run Club or Strava competitor, offering users an open source community and privacy 
          focused alternative to the centralized silos that we&apos;ve become used to.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6">Core Features</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li><span className="font-medium">Run Tracker:</span> Uses an algorithm which adjusts to your phone&apos;s location permissions and stores the data on your phone locally</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium">Stats:</span> Stored locally on your phone with a basic profile screen so users can monitor calories burned during runs</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium">Nostr Feed:</span> Made up of kind1 notes that contain #RUNSTR and other running related hashtags</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium">Music:</span> Brought to you via a wavlake API, enabling your wavlake playlists and liked songs to be seen and played in the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-6">In Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve just barely begun this thing and it&apos;ll be an up and down journey trying to push it into existence. 
          I think RUNSTR has the potential to highlight the other things that nostr has going for it, demonstrating 
          the protocol&apos;s interoperability, flexing its permissionless identity piece, and offering an experience 
          that gives users a glimpse into what is possible when shipping into a new paradigm. Although we build 
          into an environment that often offers no solutions, you&apos;d have to be a crazy person not to try.
