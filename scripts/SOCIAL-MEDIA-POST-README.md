## What the Script Does

1. **Fetches Data**: Connects to Nostr relays and fetches workout events from the past week
2. **Calculates Rewards**: Determines who earned sats for workouts and streaks
3. **Calculates Achievements**: Identifies users who leveled up this week
4. **Generates Post**: Creates a formatted social media post with all the data
5. **Saves Output**: Saves the post to a text file with today's date

## Post Structure

The generated post includes:

### Header

## Configuration

The script uses the same configuration as other RUNSTR scripts:
- **Relays**: Standard Nostr relays for data fetching
- **Rewards**: 50 sats per workout, 50 sats per streak day
- **Level System**: Based on 10 XP per workout with predefined thresholds

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the required packages installed:
```bash
npm install @nostr-dev-kit/ndk nostr-tools
```

## Timing

Best run weekly (typically Sunday evening or Monday morning) to capture the previous week's activity and prepare for social media posting.

## Usage Tips

1. **Copy-Paste Ready**: The output is formatted for direct use on social media platforms
2. **Customizable**: Edit the `generateSocialMediaPost()` function to adjust formatting or content
3. **Backup**: The text file serves as a backup and revision history
4. **Platform Adaptation**: You may need to adjust character limits for different platforms (Twitter vs Nostr vs LinkedIn)

## Troubleshooting

- **No events found**: Check relay connectivity and date range
- **Level calculation errors**: Ensure historical data is available
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the scripts directory
- **Permission errors**: Ensure write permissions for saving the output file
