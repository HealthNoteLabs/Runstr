# Memory Leak Fixes for RUNSTR App

## Fixed Issues

We've addressed critical memory leak issues in the app that were likely causing UI crashes:

1. **Fixed Memory Leaks:**
   - ✅ GroupDiscoveryScreen.jsx: Added cleanup for WebSocket connections
   - ✅ MusicPlayer.jsx: Added proper timeout cleanup
   - ✅ WalletConnect.jsx: Added cleanup for timeouts in donation status handling
   - ✅ AudioPlayerProvider.jsx: Fixed multiple timeouts without cleanup
   - ✅ RunClub.jsx: Added proper event listener cleanup for scroll handling

2. **Dependency Array Fixes:**
   - ✅ Added proper dependency arrays to useEffect hooks to prevent excessive re-renders

## Remaining Issues to Address

While the critical memory leaks have been fixed, there are still some issues worth addressing:

1. **Direct DOM Manipulation:**
   - Several components are still using direct DOM manipulation (document.* or window.*)
   - This can cause conflicts with React's virtual DOM and lead to unpredictable behavior
   - Recommendation: Replace with React refs and proper React state management

2. **useEffect Without Dependency Arrays:**
   - Some components still have useEffect hooks without proper dependency arrays
   - Recommendation: Review all useEffect hooks and ensure they have appropriate dependency arrays

3. **Test Files:**
   - There is still a potential memory leak in NostrOfflineQueue.test.js
   - Since this is a test file, it's lower priority, but should be fixed for completeness

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Verify UI Stability:**
   - The app should be much more stable now with the critical memory leaks fixed
   - Test on real devices to confirm the crashes have been resolved

2. **Refactoring Plan:**
   - **Phase 1:** Replace direct DOM manipulation with React refs
   - **Phase 2:** Review and fix remaining useEffect hooks
   - **Phase 3:** Add error boundaries to contain potential crashes

3. **Testing:**
   - Add component unmount tests to ensure all resources are properly cleaned up
   - Consider implementing automated memory leak detection in your test suite

## Performance Recommendations

To further optimize the app performance:

1. **Memoization:**
   - Use React.memo for components that re-render frequently
   - Use useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations or callbacks

2. **Throttling/Debouncing:**
   - Implement throttling for scroll handlers and other frequent events
   - Use debouncing for search inputs and other user inputs

3. **Lazy Loading:**
   - Expand the existing lazy loading approach to more components
   - Consider implementing route-based code splitting

## Monitoring

1. **Implement proper logging:**
   - Add structured logging for errors and component lifecycle events
   - Consider adding performance monitoring

2. **Crash Reporting:**
   - Implement a crash reporting system to catch any remaining issues
   - Use React Error Boundaries to prevent full app crashes
