- **Prioritize Accuracy Over Speculation**
    - Always provide solutions based on confirmed information or clearly stated assumptions.
    - If information is lacking, ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions.

- **Minimize Complexity**
    - Favor simple and maintainable approaches.
    - If multiple approaches exist, recommend the simplest one that meets all requirements.

- **Preserve Existing Functionality**
    - Ensure solutions do not introduce regressions.
    - Avoid modifying or removing existing features unless explicitly requested.

- **Avoid Duplication**
    - Do not duplicate features or capabilities already present in the application.
    - Before proposing new functionality, check if similar capabilities exist.

- **Clarity and Focus**
    - Clearly indicate when making assumptions due to incomplete information.
    - Focus on practical implementation rather than theoretical possibilities.
    - If additional context is needed for an accurate solution, ask clarifying questions.
