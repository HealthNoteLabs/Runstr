# Guidelines for AI Code Assistance with RUNSTR App

## Understanding Verification
1. Before writing any code, summarize your understanding of the requested feature in 2-3 sentences
2. Identify which existing components will be affected by the changes
3. Ask clarifying questions about any ambiguous requirements before proceeding

## Code Modification Rules
1. Do not modify core tracking functionality (GPS, distance calculation, timing mechanisms)
2. Preserve all existing data structures and only extend them when explicitly instructed
3. Never remove existing features or UI elements unless specifically requested
4. When suggesting new components, verify they don't conflict with existing naming conventions
5. Focus only on the specific feature requested and avoid suggesting unrelated "improvements"

## RUNSTR App Specifics
1. Preserve all Nostr connectivity and data publishing functionality
2. Maintain existing state management patterns and data flow
3. Always preserve any Bitcoin/Lightning integration features
4. Keep existing settings structure and only add to it, never reorganize without permission
5. Don't modify any authentication or user profile management features

## Implementation Approach
1. First suggest changes to data models/types
2. Then show UI component modifications
3. Finally demonstrate context/state management changes
4. Provide all code in context (show where in the file it belongs)
5. Flag any potential conflicts or edge cases that need consideration

## Before Submitting
1. Review the code for consistency with the existing codebase style
2. Verify the changes address ONLY what was requested
3. List any files that will be modified by your suggestion
4. Highlight any assumptions you made that should be verified
