# Multi-Modal Development Assistant Framework

## Introduction

The Multi-Modal Development Assistant Framework is a comprehensive system designed to address the complex needs of modern software development projects. By dividing responsibilities into specialized modes, each focused on a particular aspect of the development process, the framework enables teams to leverage focused expertise exactly when and where it's needed.

This guide provides detailed information on how to effectively use the framework, including an overview of each specialized mode, how to orchestrate tasks across modes, example workflows, and best practices.

## Framework Architecture

The framework consists of seven distinct modes:

1. **Six Specialized Modes** - Each focused on a specific domain of expertise:
   - Designer Mode
   - Backend Developer Mode
   - Frontend Developer Mode
   - Full Stack Developer Mode
   - DevOps Mode
   - Founder Mode

2. **Boomerang Mode** - The orchestration layer that coordinates work across specialized modes

This architecture enables complex problems to be decomposed into specialized sub-tasks, assigned to the appropriate expert mode, and then synthesized back into a cohesive solution.
